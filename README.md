# Stephan Taylor: CPNT - 262 - Achievement #3

## Code Journal

- I watched this tutorial video last night and attempted to re-create an image slider without refering to his video. I was successfuly able to do a lot of it without his help until a got to the js portion.
  - I struggled to remember how to implement query selector and event selectors.
    - However, once I saw it, it seem very self explanitory
  - I would like to point out that i did initially forget to add a `defer` to the scripts. So I was very frustrated at first on why the slider wasn't moving. I googled why i Was getting that eror and google told be that I was missing from the scripts...I felt stupid
- All in all, this was a fun little project that helped me understand selectors a lot better and how they connect with html
